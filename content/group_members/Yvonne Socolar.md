Yvonne is a PhD student in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management at Berkeley. From farm labor on smallholder vegetable operations to food stamps outreach to baking professionally, Yvonne’s career before grad school traced food from healthy soils to healthy communities. Her research interests now lie at the agriculture-environment-health nexus, and she studies how agricultural practices that promote farms’ ecological health can be employed to improve crops’ nutritional quality, particularly in the face of climate change. Prior to Berkeley, Yvonne received a BA in Biology from Swarthmore College and an MS in Agriculture, Food and Environment from Tufts University.
