### Join the Lab
I am always interested in inquiries from potential undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows with common research interests. Please contact me if you are interested in exploring one of these opportunities.

#### Undergraduates

Undergraduate students can get involved in the lab's research in a number of ways. Undergrads may apply to work in our group through various UC Berkeley programs, such as [URAP](http://urap.berkeley.edu/) and [SPUR](https://nature.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-research/spur/).

#### Graduate Students

Interested graduate students may apply to work with me through the [graduate program](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/the-phd-program) of the [Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/about-espm). I encourage all potential students to get in touch with me prior to submitting an application to ESPM, so that we can discuss interests, potential projects, and funding options (e.g., [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [USDA AFRI ELI Pre-doctoral Fellowships](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-food-agriculture-natural-resources), [Ford Foundation](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962), and the [Livermore Graduate Scolars Program](https://lgsp.llnl.gov/) (post-quals only)). Generally, I am looking for students with a strong background in biological and/or physical sciences driven to use ecological principles to improve agriculture. I am particularly interested in students who want to work in interdisciplinary teams, and who are excited about the prospect of field work. I would also encourage prospective students to read advice on applying to graduate programs in ecological fields, such as [here](https://nature.berkeley.edu/BrasharesGroup/advice/).

#### Postdoctoral Fellows

I am always interested in inquiries from potential postdocs with overlapping interests; please contact me! There are several potential opportunities to fund a postdoc in my lab, including [UC Berkeley’s Miller Fellowship](http://miller.berkeley.edu/fellowship), [UC’s President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/), [USDA AFRI ELI Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-food-agriculture-natural-resources), [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622), and the [Ford Foundation](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171940), among others. I am also interested and willing to write standard grants with prospective postdocs to fund a position, and happy to provide advice and feedback on grant applications.

### Current openings in the lab
* I will be looking for 1 PhD student during the Fall 2018 application cycle, to begin Fall 2019. I am particularly interested in applicants with skills in numerical modeling or microbial bioinformatics, and interested in working in an interdisciplinary context. See above for details and please email me if interested! I will try to get back to you within several days.
