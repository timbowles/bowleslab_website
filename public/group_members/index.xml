      <description>&lt;p&gt;My research interests lie at the intersection of soil science, agroecology, and spatial science. Using quantitative biogeochemical approaches and social science research methods, I seek to link how specific management regimes of organic farmers in Yolo County, California reflect measured and perceived impacts to on-farm soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cole is pursuing a PhD in the Materials Science and Engineering Department with a focus on biogeochemical cycling governed by nanophase particles in soil systems. Studying complexation of organics and nutrients by clay minerals using Cryo-TEM, XRD, and other spectroscopic methods, Cole hopes to uncover how clays act as reactive sites for microbial metabolism and nutrient exchange in soils. In addition, iron oxyhydroxides nanoparticles have high sorption capacities for metal contaminants and govern dispersal and remediation processes. Using atomic resolution HRTEM, Cole hopes to discover the complex surface crystal structures that mediate arsenic, chromium, mercury, lead, and selenium sorption, with an ultimate focus on bioavailability and transport kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a member of Jillian Banfield&amp;rsquo;s lab and affiliated with the Bowles lab through his interest in urban agroecology and soil processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soils harbor enormous biodiversity. We are just beginning to understand how soil organisms and
their diversity contribute to the functioning of ecosystems. Moreover, evidence is increasing that human soil management can have adverse effects on soil biological communities and,
potentially, also the functions they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research focusses on disentangling the complex relationships between agricultural
management, soil biological communities and ecosystem functions. I’m especially interested in
identifying ways to integrate soil biologically provided ecosystem services into agricultural
management schemes, an approach termed ‘Soil Ecological Engineering’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a combination of field and greenhouse experimentation to understand the functional
potential of the different members of soil biological communities and to assess how these
functional implications change under different management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my research covers a range of different soil organisms, I particularly focus on plant
symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, their interactions with the wider soil food web and how these affect nutrient use efficiency and crop nutrition in agricultural systems.&lt;/p&gt;
