      <description>&lt;p&gt;Water availability in California and across much of the world will become increasingly scarce and variable as climate change affects precipitation patterns and urban residents use more available water. We study the implications of these changes for crop productivity and environmental pollution, particularly how agroecological approaches can help address challenges. Ongoing work, funded by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/14165/crisassist.txt?action=koy9zkJ-_aqNMWzhuVxVh605fLa-P1go8ch4l3OrpWLq_8DdhSY1r&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USDA AFRI Foundational grant&lt;/a&gt;, examines how crop rotational diversity affect soil health and the soil microbiome, and in turn, the extent to which more diverse rotations suffer fewer yield losses in more stressful conditions. A related synthesis/review project examines how nitrogen losses from agricultural systems may worsen with climate change-driven changes in precipitation patterns, and how agrocological approaches at multiple scales will be key to mitigating these losses, rather than just fertilizer management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rhizosphere ecology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rhizosphere is the hotspot of biological activity in and around plant roots. Addressing some of the biggest challenges in agricultural systems, such as enhancing nutrient and water cycling to improve resource use, depend on better understanding and management of rhizosphere processes. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are an ancient and near-ubiquitous association between plant roots and a specialized group of soil fungi that facilitate nutrient uptake and other functions in exchange for energy. We use a variety of approaches to study this symbiotic interaction &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;, often using a tomato model system with paired AM and non-AM genotypes. Recent and ongoing work has focused on how AM fungi affect responses of plants and ecosystem processes, especially nitrogen cycling and losses, under lower and more variable water regimes (Bowles et al., 2016 &lt;em&gt;STOTEN&lt;/em&gt;, Bowles et al., 2017 &lt;em&gt;Global Change Biology&lt;/em&gt;). We also recently completed a meta-analysis showing how cover cropping and lower intensity tillage have similar, positive effects on the extent to which AM fungi colonize cash crop roots, a proxy of potential function (Bowles et al., 2016 &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Ecology&lt;/em&gt;). Other ongoing work focuses on how long-term plant-soil feedbacks affect belowground processes during drought, by studying the effects of crop rotational diversity on microbial community structure and function and plant-soil-microbe interactions under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soil health and ecosystem services</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Restoring and maintaining soil health are essential to making agriculture viable in the long-term. Soil health describes the dynamic properties of soil that can be changed by management, especially soil organic matter, soil biota, and chemical characteristics like pH. Thus soil health is distinct from intrinsic soil characteristics like texture, although these factors strongly influence soil health. The metaphor of &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; implies that soils can range from a &amp;ldquo;diseased&amp;rdquo; state to a &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; state, the latter marked by an active and diverse biological community and stable or increasing levels of soil organic matter that support key ecological functions like nutrient cycling and retention, water infiltration and storage, pest suppression, productivity with minimal nonrenewable inputs, and ultimately, resilience to stress. Yet intensively-managed agricultural systems mainly create sickly soils. Broadly, we are interested in how farmers&amp;rsquo; innovations restore and maintain soil health, and the ecological consequences of doing so. Through collaborations with social scientists and environmental policy experts, we are also interested in barriers, opportunities, and enabling conditions for adopting practices that support soil health. Previous research occurred with organic farmers in Yolo Co., California, and investigated how farmers could achieve high yields and low potential for nitrogen losses (Bowles et al, 2014, &lt;em&gt;Soil Biology and Biochemistry&lt;/em&gt;, Bowles et al, 2015, &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, Margenot et al., 2015 &lt;em&gt;SSSAJ&lt;/em&gt;). High levels of total and labile soil organic matter were a key feature of farms that could achieve both. New interdisciplinary research will focus on the Central Coast region of California, America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Salad Bowl&amp;rdquo; and a statewide assessment of soil health barriers and opportunities lead by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://food.berkeley.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Berkeley Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
