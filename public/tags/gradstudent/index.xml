      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management in both Dr. Claire Kremen’s and Dr. Timothy Bowles’s labs. Having deep family roots in agriculture, I am compelled to understand the socio-ecological linkages of diversified farming systems. My research builds on the knowledge produced in ecology, soil microbiology, pollination biology, and sociology of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my dissertation, I am working with small-scale farmers embedded in the monoculture landscape of California&amp;rsquo;s Central Valley. My research explores how on-farm diversification practices impact soil health and link to other ecological processes (i.e. pollination) on agroecosystems. Specifically, I am looking at how on-farm diversification (i.e. crop diversity over space and time) influence arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), pollination, and their interactions. Throughout my research, I aim to integrate social and ecological research approaches to support farmers, rural livelihoods, and ecological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yvonne is a PhD student in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management at Berkeley. From farm labor on smallholder vegetable operations to food stamps outreach to baking professionally, Yvonne’s career before grad school traced food from healthy soils to healthy communities. Her research interests now lie at the agriculture-environment-health nexus, and she studies how agricultural practices that promote farms’ ecological health can be employed to improve crops’ nutritional quality, particularly in the face of climate change. Prior to Berkeley, Yvonne received a BA in Biology from Swarthmore College and an MS in Agriculture, Food and Environment from Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My research interests lie at the intersection of soil science, agroecology, and spatial science. Using quantitative biogeochemical approaches and social science research methods, I seek to link how specific management regimes of organic farmers in Yolo County, California reflect measured and perceived impacts to on-farm soil health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cole is pursuing a PhD in the Materials Science and Engineering Department with a focus on biogeochemical cycling governed by nanophase particles in soil systems. Studying complexation of organics and nutrients by clay minerals using Cryo-TEM, XRD, and other spectroscopic methods, Cole hopes to uncover how clays act as reactive sites for microbial metabolism and nutrient exchange in soils. In addition, iron oxyhydroxides nanoparticles have high sorption capacities for metal contaminants and govern dispersal and remediation processes. Using atomic resolution HRTEM, Cole hopes to discover the complex surface crystal structures that mediate arsenic, chromium, mercury, lead, and selenium sorption, with an ultimate focus on bioavailability and transport kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a member of Jillian Banfield&amp;rsquo;s lab and affiliated with the Bowles lab through his interest in urban agroecology and soil processes.&lt;/p&gt;
