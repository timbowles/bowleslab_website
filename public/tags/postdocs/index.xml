      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microbes are key players in the global carbon and nutrient cycles, and the engines of ecosystem
functions. My research focuses on understanding how microbial communities control soil carbon and
nutrient cycling in both natural and agricultural systems, as well as their stability and resilience to climate changes. I am particularly interested in soil organic nitrogen cycling, the regulation of carbon and nitrogen cycling through adjustments in microbial community physiology (microbial carbon and nitrogen use efficiency), and the coupling of microbial carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling during organic matter decomposition. I use a vast range of methods to study soil biogeochemical processes, and I have particular experience in stable isotope-based approaches.
Over the past years, I have become increasingly interested in soil health, particularly in the context of soil fertility and sustainable agriculture. At the Bowles Lab, I am currently investigating how crop rotational diversity affects the plant-soil-microbe interactions that underlie beneficial microbiomes and soil health, and how in turn they contribute to greater resilience of crop productivity to droughts and heat waves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soils harbor enormous biodiversity. We are just beginning to understand how soil organisms and
their diversity contribute to the functioning of ecosystems. Moreover, evidence is increasing that human soil management can have adverse effects on soil biological communities and,
potentially, also the functions they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research focusses on disentangling the complex relationships between agricultural
management, soil biological communities and ecosystem functions. I’m especially interested in
identifying ways to integrate soil biologically provided ecosystem services into agricultural
management schemes, an approach termed ‘Soil Ecological Engineering’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a combination of field and greenhouse experimentation to understand the functional
potential of the different members of soil biological communities and to assess how these
functional implications change under different management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my research covers a range of different soil organisms, I particularly focus on plant
symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, their interactions with the wider soil food web and how these affect nutrient use efficiency and crop nutrition in agricultural systems.&lt;/p&gt;
